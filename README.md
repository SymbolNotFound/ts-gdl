# ts-gdl v0.1

TypeScript implementation of GDL (Games Description Language) 
in both KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format) and HRF (Human-Readable
Format).  The former is very s-expression based, with `?` prefixed
to any symbol intended as a variable.  The latter looks
more like Prolog or Datalog with the `:-` arrow and uppercase letters
indicating variables.

This is still a work in progress, check back soon!
